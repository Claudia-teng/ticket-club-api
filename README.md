## Login

- email: demo@test.com
- password: demodemo

Each account can only purchase 4 tickets per show. If the account reaches the limit, you can sign up for a new account to purchase again.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js, Express, Socket.IO
- Database: RDS(MySQL), Redis
- Cloud Service: EC2, S3, CloudFront, Elastic Load Balance, Auto Scaling, CloudWatch EventBridge, Lambda
- CD: GitHub Action, Docker, Code Deploy

## Architecture Diagram

<img width="60%" alt="architecture-diagram" src="./public/readme/architecture-diagram.png">

## Features

- Limit the number of people visiting the event selling page to prevent server crashes.
- Apply "queuing psychology" and calculate the estimated waiting time for each user by using **WebSocket** and **Redis** List & Hash.
- Use **Elastic Load Balancing** and **Auto Scaling** to scale out servers.
- Use **CloudWatch EventBridge** to schedule **Lambda** to warm up instances before each selling event starts.
- Update seat status (selected, locked, sold) by WebSocket during selling time to reduce race conditions.
- Implement continuous deployment by **GitHub Actions, Docker, Code Deploy** to automatically update app versions across multiple instances.

## Update Seat Status

<img width="100%" alt="update-seat-status" src="./public/readme/update-seat.gif">

Tools: Socket.IO, MySQL Lock

- Update seat status immediately to avoid two users getting the same seat at the same time as much as possible
- Use MySQL lock to ensure every seat can only be successfully selected by one user.

## Queuing System

- Limit the number of people visiting the event selling page to prevent server crashes.
- Apply "queuing psychology" and calculate the estimated waiting time for each user by using **WebSocket** and **Redis** List & Hash.

### How do I implement the queuing system?

Tool: Redis (List & Hash)

<img width="60%" alt="redis" src="./public/readme/redis.png">

1. Use `List` to record the order of people entering ticket selling page.
2. Use `Hash` to record the timestamp of each user entering the ticket selling page.
3. If the session queue is full, the new arriving requests will enqueue to the waiting queue.
4. There is a 10-minute time limit for the purchasing process. Use the index to find the corresponding user that each queuing user should wait for and calculate the estimated waiting time.

For example:

<img width="50%" alt="explain" src="./public/readme/explain.gif">

If the limit of visiting the ticket selling page is set to 3...

1. User 1 arrived, successfully get into the ticket selling page.
2. User 2 arrived, successfully get into the ticket selling page.
3. User 3 arrived, successfully get into the ticket selling page.
4. User 4 arrived, failed to get into the ticket selling page, placed 1st in the queue.
5. User 5 arrived, failed to get into the ticket selling page, placed 2nd in the queue.
6. User 6 arrived, failed to get into the ticket selling page, placed 3nd in the queue.

**Calculate estimated waiting time**

1. User 4 needs to wait for 1 person, and its waiting time is (10 minutes - User 1's timestamp) + 10 seconds buffer.
2. User 5 needs to wait for 2 people, and its waiting time is (10 minutes - User 2's timestamp) + 10 seconds buffer.
3. User 6 needs to wait for 3 people, and its waiting time is (10 minutes - User 3's timestamp) + 10 seconds buffer.

**Scenario 1: User 1 completed a purchase**

<img width="50%" alt="Scenario 1" src="./public/readme/scenario1.gif">

1. Let the first user in queue (User 4) get into the page.
2. Update waiting information for all users in queue.

- Update User 5's waiting info: wait for 1 person, waiting time is (10 minutes - User 2's timestamp).
- Update User 6's waiting info: wait for 2 people, waiting time is (10 minutes - User 3's timestamp).

**Scenario 2: User 4 left the queue**

<img width="50%" alt="Scenario 2" src="./public/readme/scenario2.gif">

1. Find Users queuing behind User 4, and update their waiting information.

- Update User 5's waiting info: wait for 1 person, waiting time is (10 minutes - User 1's timestamp).
- Update User 6's waiting info: wait for 1 person, waiting time is (10 minutes - User 2's timestamp).

**Scenario 3: User 2 left the page without buying**

<img width="50%" alt="Scenario 3" src="./public/readme/scenario3.gif">

1. Let the first user in queue (User 4) get into the page.
2. Update waiting information for all users in queue.

- Update User 5's waiting info: wait for 1 person, waiting time is (10 minutes - User 1's timestamp).
- Update User 6's waiting info: wait for 1 person, waiting time is (10 minutes - User 2's timestamp).

## Load Test

Concert ticket selling website must be capable of handling high traffic.

I use WebSocket to confirm if a user is still on the page or in the queue, so I implemented a load test to check the max socket connections with both horizontal and vertical scaling and compared two scaling results & costs.

Code: https://github.com/Claudia-teng/ticket-club-load-test/blob/main/connection-time.js

### Horizontal Scaling

I used t3.micro to observe the connection growth as more instances were added. The connections have increased but did not exactly double from 30,000 to 60,000 if a new instance was added.

<img width="60%" alt="horizontal-scaling" src="./public/readme/horizontal-scaling.png">

### Vertical Scaling

By upgrading the instance type from t3.micro to t3.small, the max connections have increased more than one time from 30,000 to 80,000.

<img width="60%" alt="vertical-scaling" src="./public/readme/vertical-scaling.png">

### Comparison

Assuming the goal is to provide 80,000 stable socket connections, if the instances run for 30 days, vertical scaling comes with a lower cost.

<img width="80%" alt="scaling-comparison" src="./public/readme/scaling-comparison.png">

However, horizontal scaling with t3.small should also be implemented to verify the comparison of two scaling methods, as it might be the poor performance from t3.micro.
